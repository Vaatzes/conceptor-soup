# Conceptor Soup

## Overview
An open-source project aimed at improving model soups using conceptors, focusing on Transformer models but applicable to other architectures.

## Objectives
- Integrate conceptors with Transformer model soups.
- Analyse model soups using the mathematical conceptor framework.
- Improve model soup performance and efficiency.

## ToDo List
- [ ] Literature review on conceptors and model soups.
- [ ] Baseline performance evaluation of model soups.
- [ ] Theoretical framework development for conceptor integration.
- [ ] Prototype implementation and evaluation.
- [ ] Documentation and refinement based on feedback.

## Usage
To be determined.
